        Iceland is one of the world’s most
        incredible destinations, largely
        due to it’s jaw-dropping natural
        landscape. It has everything from
        lava ﬁelds to glaciers. It’s a dream
        destination if you love the great
        outdoors and exploring everything
        that nature has to offer. However,
        planning a tour of Iceland and
        organizing the logistics by
        yourself can quickly turn into a
        nightmare, as you’ll have loads of
        questions about how to get the
        best out of your vacation.

        <h1>Overwhelming Questions</h1>
        <p><span>Some of your questions might include: How can you possibly decide what’s worth seeing when there are so
          many things to choose from like volcanos, geysers, waterfalls, hot water</span> springs, basalt columns, huge crevices,
          glaciers, lagunes, and mud pools, and when several months wouldn’t be enough to see it all?
        </p>
        <p>
          • Once you do have a rough itinerary, how can it be arranged so that it doesn’t cost an<br> arm and a leg?<br>
          • Where should you book your stay and what should you eat in a country where a bed in a hostel can cost 100
          euros a night?<br>
          • What is the best time of year to go so the inclement weather doesn’t ruin your plans?<br>
          • Is it better to go in winter when it’s cold and dark, or in summer when it’s light for 20 hours each day?<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bts-answer">
        <h1>BTS Has<br> the Answers</h1>
        <p class="bigger-p">Beyond the Standard’s answers to these tricky questions is two campervan tours of Ice-land; one in the
          winter, one
          in summer. Each tour is organized by local Icelandic tour guides who jam pack the tour with both the
          absolute
          must-see sights and hidden gems.</p>
        <p>The campervan is a transformed mini bus with heating, a table, chairs, a basic kitchen, a bed and bedding.
          By
          going with a campervan, you’ll get the spontaneity and adventure of backpacking, while also enjoying the
          comfort
          of a hotel stay. There’s always a place you can escape to when you need a moment, and you’ll have a warm bed
          to
          sleep in at the end of a long and exciting day.</p>
        <p class="bigger-p">It’s important to be flexible when touring Iceland. Your tour guides will keep an eye on the weather
          forecasts,
          and things can always be adapted if rain clouds make the existing plan tricky. In a country where it rains
          almost
          every day, the best kind of tour is one that can escape the clouds at a moment's notice. By keeping an eye
          on the
          weather and trying to steer clear of clouds, we have the best chance of seeing the northern lights during
          the
          winter tour.</p>
        <p>In Iceland, forward thinking and planning is super important, when it comes to keeping the reins on our
          budget
          too. One of the ways we keep the cost of our tour affordable, is by shopping for local ingredients together
          and
          cooking meals on our campervan’s grill.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, there are some things in Iceland, which are actually cheaper than in other parts of the
          world.
          These include world-class lamb hearts, cod, crustaceans, lamb, and beef. Forget that old stereotype of
          fermented
          shark meat!</p>

      <h3><span>D1 —</span> Arrival, hot river, and lava tunnel <span>(100 km)</span></h3>
      <p>Arriving at Keflavík airport, we’ll pick up our campervans. Then we’ll travel to the island’s south western
        corner to Hveragerði. Here we’ll check out the bubbling hot springs, and enjoy an excursion to the boiling
        lake where you can also bathe if you wish. Nearby, we’ll visit a lava tunnel, which is several thousands of
        years old. If you’re brave enough you can even climb inside.</p>

      <h3><span>D2 —</span> Geysers, waterfalls, and natural baths <span>(230 km)</span></h3>
      <p>Iceland’s most famous sight has got to be Geysir, after which geysers got their name. Gull-foss is the most
        famous of Iceland’s waterfalls, and after visiting it, we’ll explore another waterfall called Skógafoss from
        above, underneath, outside, and inside. We’ll actually spend tonight at the foot of this waterfall. For those
        who still have energy to burn, we’ll visit the outdoor swimming pool at Seljavallalaug, which is half natural
        and half man-made.</p>

      <h3><span>D3 —</span> Basalt columns, canyon, glacier <span>(180 km)</span></h3>
      <p>First up, we’ll visit the beautiful black basalt columns at Reynisfjara, which is situated on an impressive
        black sandy beach. Then, we’ll visit a stunning canyon before spending the night at Skaftafell at the foot of
        the Vatnajökull glacier.</p>

      <h3><span>D4 —</span> Icebergs, seals, and Scandinavian townships <span>(140 km)</span></h3>
      <p>In the morning we’ll climb up a hill and look out to see how icebergs and ice walls separate from the glacier
        and float out into the ocean. In what promises to be a magical moment, seals will play all around us. We’ll
        spend the evening in a small town called Höfn, where they serve the best lobster in all of Iceland. There’s
        also a great pool in Höfn where we can soak in the warm water or zip down water slides.</p>

      <h3><span>D5 —</span> Fishing village, fjords, northern lights <span>(420 km)</span></h3>
      <p>We’ll drive a lot, but the upside is that we’ll travel along the most beautiful scenic route available. We’ll
        pass fewer and fewer cars as we head to the north-west of the island. We’ll stop by a fishing village on the
        banks of a fjord, which would actually be the perfect set for a Wes Anderson film. We’ll spend the night right
        up north, on the banks of the Myvatn lake. If we’re lucky and it’s a clear night, we’ll be able to see the
        northern lights, too.</p>

      <h3><span>D6 —</span> Bright blue thermal waters, a geothermal display, lava fields, and the north’s capital
        Akureyri <span>(120 km)</span></h3>
      <p>Before we go swimming in what could be one of Iceland’s most beautifully bright blue thermal baths, we’ll
        visit an incredibly active geothermal display, full of bubbling mud pots and steam rising from the earth. Here
        at Hverirt we’ll also visit a lava field and the world's largest geothermal power plant. We’ll spend the night
        in Akureyri, which is Iceland's second biggest city. Tonight we’ll sleep not in our campervan but in a capsule
        hotel, which you might recognize if you’re into Japanese sci-fi.</p>
