	<h3><span>D1 —</span> Arrival, hot river, and lava tunnel <span>(100 km)</span></h3>
	<p>Arriving at Keflavík airport, we’ll pick up our campervans. Then we’ll travel to the island’s south western corner to Hveragerði. Here we’ll check out the bubbling hot springs, and enjoy an excursion to the boiling lake where you can also bathe if you wish. Nearby, we’ll visit a lava tunnel, which is several thousands of years old. If you’re brave enough you can even climb inside.</p>

	<h3><span>D2 —</span> Geysers, waterfalls, and natural baths <span>(230 km)</span></h3>
	<p>Iceland’s most famous sight has got to be Geysir, after which geysers got their name. Gullfoss is the most famous of Iceland’s waterfalls, and after visiting it, we’ll explore another waterfall called Skógafoss from above, underneath, outside, and inside. We’ll actually spend tonight at the foot of this waterfall. For those who still have energy to burn, we’ll visit the outdoor swimming pool at Seljavallalaug, which is half natural and half man-made.</p>

	<h3><span>D3 —</span> Basalt columns, canyon, glacier <span>(180 km)</span></h3>
	<p>First up, we’ll visit the beautiful black basalt columns at Reynisfjara, which is situated on an impressive black sandy beach. Then, we’ll visit a stunning canyon before spending the night at Skaftafell at the foot of the Vatnajökull glacier.</p>

	<h3><span>D4 —</span> Icebergs, seals, and Scandinavian townships <span>(140 km)</span></h3>
	<p>In the morning we’ll climb up a hill and look out to see how icebergs and ice walls separate from the glacier and float out into the ocean. In what promises to be a magical moment, seals will play all around us. We’ll spend the evening in a small town called Höfn, where they serve the best lobster in all of Iceland. There’s also a great pool in Höfn where we can soak in the warm water or zip down water slides.</p>

	<h3><span>D5 —</span> Fishing village, fjords, northern lights <span>(420 km)</span></h3>
	<p>We’ll drive a lot, but the upside is that we’ll travel along the most beautiful scenic route available. We’ll pass fewer and fewer cars as we head to the north-west of the island. We’ll stop by a fishing village on the banks of a fjord, which would actually be the perfect set for a Wes Anderson film. We’ll spend the night right up north, on the banks of the Myvatn lake. If we’re lucky and it’s a clear night, we’ll be able to see the northern lights, too.</p>

	<h3><span>D6 —</span> Bright blue thermal waters, a geothermal display, lava fields, and the north’s capital Akureyri <span>(120 km)</span></h3>
	<p>Before we go swimming in what could be one of Iceland’s most beautifully bright blue thermal baths, we’ll visit an incredibly active geothermal display, full of bubbling mud pots and steam rising from the earth. Here at Hverirt we’ll also visit a lava field and the world's largest geothermal power plant. We’ll spend the night in Akureyri, which is Iceland's second biggest city. Tonight we’ll sleep not in our campervan but in a capsule hotel, which you might recognize if you’re into Japanese sci-fi.</p>
