    <h1>Overwhelming Questions</h1>
    <p>Some of your questions might include: How can you possibly decide what’s worth seeing when there are so
      many
      things to choose from like volcanos, geysers, waterfalls, hot water springs, basalt columns, huge crevices,
      glaciers, lagunes, and mud pools, and when several months wouldn’t be enough to see it all?
    </p>
    <p>
      • Once you do have a rough itinerary, how can it be arranged so that it doesn’t cost an arm and a leg?<br>
      • Where should you book your stay and what should you eat in a country where a bed in a hostel can cost 100
      euros a night?<br>
      • What is the best time of year to go so the inclement weather doesn’t ruin your plans?<br>
      • Is it better to go in winter when it’s cold and dark, or in summer when it’s light for 20 hours each day?<br>

    <p>Beyond the Standard’s answers to these tricky questions is two campervan tours of Ice-land; one in the
      winter, one
      in summer. Each tour is organized by local Icelandic tour guides who jam pack the tour with both the
      absolute
      must-see sights and hidden gems.</p>

    <p>The campervan is a transformed mini bus with heating, a table, chairs, a basic kitchen, a bed and bedding.
      By
      going with a campervan, you’ll get the spontaneity and adventure of backpacking, while also enjoying the
      comfort
      of a hotel stay. There’s always a place you can escape to when you need a moment, and you’ll have a warm bed
      to
      sleep in at the end of a long and exciting day.</p>
    <p>It’s important to be flexible when touring Iceland. Your tour guides will keep an eye on the weather
      forecasts,
      and things can always be adapted if rain clouds make the existing plan tricky. In a country where it rains
      almost
      every day, the best kind of tour is one that can escape the clouds at a moment's notice. By keeping an eye
      on the
      weather and trying to steer clear of clouds, we have the best chance of seeing the northern lights during
      the
      winter tour.</p>

  <div class="p-cont">
    <p>In Iceland, forward thinking and planning is super important, when it comes to keeping the reins on our
      budget
      too. One of the ways we keep the cost of our tour affordable, is by shopping for local ingredients together
      and
      cooking meals on our campervan’s grill.</p>
    <p>Surprisingly, there are some things in Iceland, which are actually cheaper than in other parts of the
      world.
      These include world-class lamb hearts, cod, crustaceans, lamb, and beef. Forget that old stereotype of
      fermented
      shark meat!</p>
